## Methods/key words
- Triangular Simplification
- Retopology
- mesh re-coding

## Simplication methods
- vertex decimation
- mesh decimation
- iterative edge contraction
- Schroeder's Decimation
- edge collapses

## Detail Measurement Methods
- approximation error (Geometric distance using Eavg metric derived from Hausdorff distance)
- metrological deviation
- 
# R&D topic statement
The purpose here to take a high ploy generated convex mesh and to create a lower poly count,
but as geometrically "accurate" as possible to the original as quickly possible.

- What alogirthim is the fastest?
- What algoirthim produces the best detail with the least geometry?
- What alogirthim has the best balance of these two?

## Week 2 summary
### Need for work
- Not much/any in the field of apply simplication in real-time to a real-time generated mesh
- a lot of work is old (pre 2010)
- nothing focused on real-time terrain generation in games
### Refined research question
Out of a given set of triangular simplification algoirthims, which has the best balance of execution time to geometric accuracy for real-time terrain generation?
