	abstract = {Cultural heritage’s structural changes and damages can influence the mechanical behaviour of artefacts and buildings. The use of finite element methods ({FEM}) for mechanical analysis is largely used in modelling stress behaviour. The workflow involves the use of {CAD} 3D models and the use of non-uniform rational B-spline ({NURBS}) surfaces. For cultural heritage objects, altered by the time elapsed since their creation, the representation created with the {CAD} model may introduce an extreme level of approximation, leading to wrong simulation results. The focus of this work is to present an alternative method intending to generate the most accurate 3D representation of a real artefact from highly accurate 3D reality-based models, simplifying the original models to make them suitable for finite element analysis ({FEA}) software. The approach proposed, and tested on three different case studies, was based on the intelligent use of retopology procedures to create a simplified model to be converted to a mathematical one made by {NURBS} surfaces, which is also suitable for being processed by volumetric meshes typically embedded in standard {FEM} packages. This allowed us to obtain {FEA} results that were closer to the actual mechanical behaviour of the analysed heritage asset.},

	abstract = {In the past 20 years, several methods have been proposed for re-coding 3D models with a low-spatial-frequency 3D representation plus a high-frequency 2D map for recovering the details. This approach has been explored with different kinds of mapping (bump, normal, relief, parallax, displacement), which have been shown to be effective in dramatically reducing model size while still maintaining a good visual appearance. For this reason, these approaches are widely applied in those situations where the rendering time constraints are critical (e.g., real-time rendering of complex models for gaming). However, the significant difference between the original detailed 3D model and the re-coded version has made it impossible to consider the latter as a metrically satisfying substitute for the former. The purpose of this article is to propose a re-coding method based on displaced subdivision surfaces that makes it possible to adapt the re-coded 3D representation to the metrological limitations of the 3D capturing technique used for generating the original mesh. In this way, it is possible to keep the geometric incoherency between the re-coded and the acquired mesh below the threshold determined by the natural capturing technology uncertainty. The resulting re-coded model can be therefore considered as close to the physical object/scenario, as the original acquired mesh, with a great advantage in terms of 3D representation size, {UV} parametrization, topological coherence, and scalability. The method has been tested on three cultural heritage objects with different complexity: a damaged wooden painting by Leonardo da Vinci (a nearly 2.5D shape), a Roman stone head sculpture (full 3D shape with simple topology), and a full body bronze sculpture by Donatello (full 3D shape with complex topology), demonstrating the coherency between the re-coded models and the originals, with a model size compression depending on the topological complexity that may reach a level of better than 1:25.},

The method is simple to implement and parallelize, and it can process a variety of input surface representations, such as point clouds, range scans and triangle meshes. Our full pipeline executes instantly (less than a second) on meshes with hundreds of thousands of faces, enabling new types of interactive workflows. Since our algorithm avoids any global optimization, and its key steps scale linearly with input size, we are able to process extremely large meshes and point clouds, with sizes exceeding several hundred million elements. To demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our method, we apply it to hundreds of models of varying complexity and provide our cross-platform reference implementation in the supplemental material.},

	abstract = {The quantity and quality of the mesh elements are both significant factors for guaranteeing computational precision in the finite-element method ({FEM}). In most mesh simplification algorithms, the geometric error was thought to be the most important issue. However, the mesh quality was rarely taken into consideration. In this article, a finite triangular surface mesh simplification algorithm is proposed, in which the vertex dispersion is introduced to represent the local geometrical feature, and then either edge collapse or face collapse is carried out consequently. The aspect of the newly created face is taken into account and the position of the newly created vertex is obtained by solving an over-determined system of linear equations with respect to the aspect ratios of the newly created faces; thereupon the simplified mesh quality is improved. To obtain a further simplification and to reduce the errors in the succeeding {FEM} analysis, surface fitting is adopted on the surfaces with large curvature. Simplification cases had been performed in comparison with the quadric error metric method, and the results show that the definition of the local mesh density is more reasonable for the {FEM} analysis with the same simplification ratio while the present simplification algorithm is employed. Moreover, the mesh quality can be greatly improved on the surface with large curvature. A set of {FEM} numerical experiments of polymer injection moulding simulation had also been performed to determine the effect of the presented simplification algorithm on the {FEM} analysis. The numerical results show that the error of the injection pressure can be limited within 4 per cent, while the simplification percentage reaches 75 per cent. [{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},

Previously we described an algorithm that simplifies polygonal models using a quadric error metric. This method is fast and produces high quality approximations in practice. Here we provide some theory to explain why the algorithm works as well as it does. Using methods from differential geometry and approximation theory, we show that in the limit as triangle area goes to zero on a differentiable surface, the quadric error is directly related to surface curvature. Also, in this limit, a triangulation that minimizes the quadric error metric achieves the optimal triangle aspect ratio in that it minimizes the L2 geometric error.

Such gains are achieved by leveraging the large-scale parallelism of the {GPU} towards applications that are well-suited for these streaming architectures. By contrast, mesh simpliﬁcation has traditionally been viewed as a non-interactive process not readily amenable to {GPU} acceleration. We demonstrate how it becomes practical for real-time use through our method, and that the use of the {GPU} even for ofﬂine simpliﬁcation leads to signiﬁcant increases in performance. Our approach for mesh decimation adopts a vertexclustering method to the {GPU} by taking advantage of a new addition to the rendering pipeline - the geometry shader stage. We present a novel general-purpose data structure designed for streaming architectures called the probabilistic octree, which allows for much of the ﬂexibility of ofﬂine implementations, including sparse encoding and variable level-of-detail. We demonstrate successful use of this data structure in our {GPU} implementation of mesh simpliﬁcation. We can generate adaptive levels of detail by applying non-linear warping functions to the cluster map in order to improve resulting simpliﬁcation quality. Our {GPU}-accelerated approach enables simultaneous construction of multiple levels of detail and outof-core simpliﬁcation of extremely large polygonal meshes.},

To take full advantage of the {GPU} comprising many computing cores, we enable collapsing of connected edges to be processed at one time by breaking data dependency in the update of the mesh data structure. Our solution is a lazy update method, which temporarily stores edge update information in a table and then updates the mesh data with it in the next step. Thanks to the lazy update method, we can more freely choose a large number of edges in the form of small trees for collapsing. The constructed trees are split to satisfy an error constraint, prevent normal flipping, and preserve the mesh topology. In experiments performed on several test models of various scales, we found that our algorithm consistently outperformed the prior {GPU} algorithm of Papageorgiou and Platis (Vis Comput 31(2):235–244, 2015) by a factor of 10 or higher.},

Current simplification and compression algorithms do not take advantage of both the central processing unit ({CPU}) and the graphics processing unit ({GPU}). We propose three simplification algorithms, one of which runs on the {CPU} and two of which run on the {GPU}. We combine these algorithms into two {CPU}-{GPU} algorithms for mesh simplification. Our {CPU}-{GPU} algorithms are the naïve marking algorithm and the inverse reduction algorithm. Experimental results show that when the algorithms take advantage of both the {CPU} and the {GPU}, there is a decrease in running time for simplification compared to performing all of the computation on the {CPU}. The marking algorithm provides higher simplification rates than the inverse reduction algorithm, whereas the inverse reduction algorithm has a lower running time than the marking algorithm.},

	abstract = {Polygonal meshes are a common way of representing three dimensional surface models in many different areas of computer graphics and geometry processing. However, with the evolution of the technology, polygonal models are becoming more and more complex. As the complexity of the models increase, the visual approximation to the real world objects get better but there is a trade-off between the cost of processing these models and better visual approximation. In order to reduce this cost, the number of polygons in a model can be reduced by mesh simplification algorithms. These algorithms are widely used such that nearly all of the popular mesh editing libraries include at least one of them. In this work, polygonal simplification algorithms that are embedded in open source libraries: {CGAL}, {VTK} and {OpenMesh} are compared with the Metro geometric error measuring tool. By this way we try to supply a guidance for developers for publicly available mesh libraries in order to implement polygonal mesh simplification.},

	abstract = {Triangle mesh simplification is of great interest in a variety of knowledge domains, since it allows manipulation and visualization of large models, and it is the starting point for the design of many multiresolution representations. A crucial point in the structure of a simplification method is the definition of an appropriate metric for guiding the decimation process, with the purpose of generating low error approximations at different levels of resolution. This paper proposes two new alternative metrics for mesh simplification, with the aim of producing high-quality results with reduced execution time and memory usage, and being simple to implement. A set of different established metrics is also described and a comparative evaluation of these metrics against the two new metrics is performed. A single implementation is used in the experiments, in order to enable the evaluation of these metrics independently from other simplification aspects. Results obtained from the simplification of a number of models, using the different metrics, are compared.},

Such structure-preserving approach is well suited to planar abstraction, i.e. extreme decimation approximating well the planar parts while filtering out the others.

	abstract = {Abstract—3D models are used in many different applications.
Because their use is widespread, many distinct techniques
exist for creating, altering and optimising these models. Two
of the most researched techniques are mesh compression and
procedural content generation ({PCG}). Mesh compression is used
to compress existing models into smaller sized formats used for
transmission and storage. {PCG} is used to create content like
models algorithmically.
Even though these techniques are researched plentiful and
often used individually, no methods have been proposed for
combining both of them. The purpose of this study is to find a
possible manner of combining these techniques to gain a better
or more efficient 3D representation than when one of them is
used individually. A novel method is proposed that splits up the
3D model into two parts: a structured part and an unstructured
part. The structured part can then be generated using {PCG}
while the unstructured part is compressed and decompressed
using classic progressive mesh compression. These two parts
then are combined to form the final 3D model.
This novel method provides an alternative to classic progressive
mesh compression algorithms. Compared to these algorithms,
the novel method requires less memory space for storage
and provides better visual representations, but requires more
computation time for generating the complete model. Results
suggest that the novel method is beneficial when models have
a smaller sized unstructured part and bigger structured parts,
while progressive mesh compression is the better solution for
models with a larger unstructured part.},

To control processing time, it is often desirable to use approximations in place of excessively detailed models.We have developed a surface simplification algorithm which can rapidly produce high quality approximations of polygonal models. The algorithm uses iterative contractions of vertex pairs to simplify models and maintains surface error approximations using quadric matrices. By contracting arbitrary vertex pairs (not just edges), our algorithm is able to join unconnected regions of models. This can facilitate much better approximations, both visually and with respect to geometric error. In order to allow topological joining, our system also supports non-manifold surface models.},

While producing the same expected quality of the output meshes, the Multiple-Choice approach leads to a signiﬁcant speed-up compared to the wellestablished standard framework for mesh decimation as a greedy optimization scheme. Moreover, Multiple-Choice decimation does not require a global priority queue data structure which reduces the memory overhead and simpliﬁes the algorithmic structure. We explain why and how the {MultipleChoice} optimization works well for the mesh decimation problem and give a detailed {CPU} proﬁle analysis to explain where the speed-up comes from.},

Physically-based modeling of this complex phenomenon is a major concern in producing realistic synthesized terrains. However, despite some recent improvements, existing algorithms are still computationally expensive, leading to a time-consuming process fairly impractical for terrain designers and 3D artists. In this paper, we present a new method to model the hydraulic erosion phenomenon which runs at interactive rates on today's computers. The method is based on the velocity field of the running water, which is created with an efficient shallow-water fluid model. The velocity field is used to calculate the erosion and deposition process, and the sediment transportation process. The method has been carefully designed to be implemented totally on {GPU}, and thus takes full advantage of the parallelism of current graphics hardware. Results from experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and efficient. It can create realistic erosion effects by rainfall and river flows, and produce fast simulation results for terrains with large sizes.},

For efficient rendering this high number of primitives has to be reduced. An important property of mesh
reduction – or simplification – algorithms used for rendering is the control over the introduced geometric error.
In general, the better this control is, the slower the simplification algorithm becomes. This is especially a
problem for out-of-core simplification, since the processing time quickly reaches several hours for high-quality
simplification.
In this paper we present a new efficient algorithm to measure the Hausdorff distance between two meshes by
sampling the meshes only in regions of high distance. In addition to comparing two arbitrary meshes, this
algorithm can also be applied to check the Hausdorff error between the simplified and original meshes during
simplification. By using this information to accept or reject a simplification operation, this method allows fast
simplification while guaranteeing a user-specified geometric error.},

	title = {Quadric-Based Polygonal Surface Simplification},
	url = {http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/1999/CMU-CS-99-105.pdf},
	abstract = {Many applications in computer graphics and related fields can benefit from
automatic simplification of complex polygonal surface models. Applications are
often confronted with either very densely over-sampled surfaces or models too
complex for the limited available hardware capacity. An effective algorithm
for rapidly producing high-quality approximations of the original model is a
valuable tool for managing data complexity.
In this dissertation, I present my simplification algorithm, based on iterative vertex pair contraction. This technique provides an effective compromise
between the fastest algorithms, which often produce poor quality results, and
the highest-quality algorithms, which are generally very slow. For example, a
1000 face approximation of a 100,000 face model can be produced in about 10
seconds on a {PentiumPro} 200. The algorithm can simplify both the geometry and topology of manifold as well as non-manifold surfaces. In addition to
producing single approximations, my algorithm can also be used to generate
multiresolution representations such as progressive meshes and vertex hierarchies for view-dependent refinement.
The foundation of my simplification algorithm, is the quadric error metric
which I have developed. It provides a useful and economical characterization of
local surface shape, and I have proven a direct mathematical connection between
the quadric metric and surface curvature. A generalized form of this metric can
accommodate surfaces with material properties, such as {RGB} color or texture
coordinates.
I have also developed a closely related technique for constructing a hierarchy
of well-defined surface regions composed of disjoint sets of faces. This algorithm
involves applying a dual form of my simplification algorithm to the dual graph
of the input surface. The resulting structure is a hierarchy of face clusters which
is an effective multiresolution representation for applications such as radiosity.},

	abstract = {We address the problem of performing a topology-aware simplification algorithm on a compact and distributed data structure for triangle meshes, the Terrain trees. Topology-aware operators have been defined to coarsen a Triangulated Irregular Network ({TIN}) without affecting the topology of its underlying terrain, i.e., without modifying critical features of the terrain, such as pits, saddles, peaks, and their connectivity. However, their scalability is limited for large-scale meshes. Our proposed algorithm uses a batched processing strategy to reduce both the memory and time requirements of the simplification process, and thanks to the spatial decomposition on the basis of Terrain trees, it can be easily parallelized. Also, since a Terrain tree after the simplification process becomes less compact and efficient, we propose an efficient post-processing step for updating hierarchical spatial decomposition. Our experiments on real-world {TINs}, derived from topographic and bathymetric {LiDAR} data, demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of our approach. Specifically, topology-aware simplification on Terrain trees uses 40\% less memory and half the time compared to the most compact and efficient connectivity-based data structure for {TINs}. Furthermore, the parallel simplification algorithm on the Terrain trees exhibits a 12× speedup with an {OpenMP} implementation. The quality of the output mesh is not significantly affected by the distributed and parallel simplification strategy of Terrain trees, and we obtain similar quality levels compared to the global baseline method.},

	abstract = {We present a new algorithm, called
              marching cubes
              , that creates triangle models of constant density surfaces from 3D medical data. Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography ({CT}), magnetic resonance ({MR}), and single-photon emission computed tomography ({SPECT}) illustrate the quality and functionality of
              marching cubes
              . We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},
