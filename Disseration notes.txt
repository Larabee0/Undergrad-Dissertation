my interest lies in computer graphics, specially in the optimisation of meshes generated by a procedural terrain generation algorithim.
Optimisation here meaning low poly count, high detail
This is because I want to render many procedural generated planets at once and multi million polygon meshes become inpractcal at that point.
There is a lack of research data in this field, while there are commerical tools that do similar objectives, they are focused on 3d modelling software
rather than real time operations.

problem retopogly of a generated mesh for reduced polygon count

Question is there an alogirthim which is able to retopolgies a terrain mesh to reduce polygon count while maintaining detail?

Potential topics:
- A comparison of time performance of retoplogy algorithims minimising polygon count and maximising perceived detail in a real-time terrain generation simulation.
- A comparison of result detail of a retoplogy algorithims compared to the base mesh.




Methods/key words
- Triangular Simplification
- Retopology
- mesh re-coding

Simplication methods
- vertex decimation
- mesh decimation
- iterative edge contraction
- Schroeder's Decimation
- edge collapses

Measure methods
- approximation error (Geometric distance using Eavg metric derived from Hausdorff distance)
- metrological deviation

The purpose here to take a high ploy generated mesh and to create a lower poly count,
but still geometrically accurate to the original mesh as quickly as possible.

- What alogirthim has the best trade off of detail to performance
- What algorithms works best with terrain.
