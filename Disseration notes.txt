my interest lies in computer graphics, specially in the optimisation of meshes generated by a procedural terrain generation algorithim.
Optimisation here meaning low poly count, high detail
This is because I want to render many procedural generated planets at once and multi million polygon meshes become inpractcal at that point.
There is a lack of research data in this field, while there are commerical tools that do similar objectives, they are focused on 3d modelling software
rather than real time operations.

problem retopogly of a generated mesh for reduced polygon count

Question is there an alogirthim which is able to retopolgies a terrain mesh to reduce polygon count while maintaining detail?

Potential topics:
- A comparison of time performance of retoplogy algorithims minimising polygon count and maximising perceived detail in a real-time terrain generation simulation.
- A comparison of result detail of a retoplogy algorithims compared to the base mesh.




Methods/key words
- Triangular Simplification
- Retopology
- mesh re-coding

Simplication methods
- vertex decimation
- mesh decimation
- iterative edge contraction
- Schroeder's Decimation
- edge collapses

Measure methods
- approximation error (Geometric distance using Eavg metric derived from Hausdorff distance)
- metrological deviation
- Hausdorff distance
- Geometric Deviation

The purpose here to take a high ploy generated mesh and to create a lower poly count,
but still geometrically accurate to the original mesh as quickly as possible.

- What alogirthim has the best trade off of detail to performance
- What algorithms works best with terrain.

- Low risk project
No humans particpants
stastical analysis of computer algorithims
extremely low chance that any results could be used to harm anyone
most major concern is small use of eletricity and internet generating greenhouse effects

Title: A comparison of two GPU triangular mesh simplification algorithims on generated convex terrain mesh.

Which GPU triangular mesh simplification algorithim, A or B, is able to minimise execution time and maximise geometric quality to a runtime generated convex terrain mesh?

- which is the fastest?
- which has the highest quality? (lowest geometric error)


Hypotheses
- 1. Algorithm A runs faster than algorithim B
	(Execution time is being measured)
	> null, they execute in the same time
	> false, algorithim B is faster
	
- 2. Algorithm B produces a lower geometric error than algorithim A.
	(Geometric error is being measured)
	> null, they have the same error
	> false, algorithim A produces better results

Statistical tests: Likely a T-test on for both comparing the mean execution and mean geometric error

From those two tests it should be possible to draw a conclusion on
if alogirthim's A speed advantage is worth the quality cost or the other way around.

Data format example for one planet seed.

Algorithm     planet seed | Simplication Rate |   Execution time    | Geometric Error  | 
Algorithm A    1349123 	  |        45%		  |        20ms		    |       50%		   | 
Algorithm B    1349123    |		   45%        |        30ms  		|    	40%		   | 

Simplication rate, the % of geometry reducion - 100k Mesh being reduced by 45% to 45k
Each algorithim gets tested on the same seed then a new planet is generated to create a new test group

Should the same seed be tested multiple times to create an average? what is the run to run variance.
The time compexlity of doing this would be almost irrelevant

Depending on effect size, number of runs needs to be between 32 for a big effect (Geometric error) and 802 for a small effect (like execution time)
